          AND IN CAPITALISM, ITS ONLY SYSTEM, OUR PROSPERITY,
          WHICH WAS CONCEIVED BY THE GREED OF MAN,

        <p>
          HE ASCENDED INTO EXTREME WEALTH, AND IS SEATED AT THE RIGHT HAND OF COMMERCE, THE FATHER ALMIGHTY,
        </p>

          FROM THERE HE WILL COME TO JUDGE THE RICH AND THE POOR.

        <p>
          I BELIEVE IN CONSUMERISM, THE HOLY CHURCH OF COMMERCE, THE ENSLAVEMENT OF SOULS, THE SACRED BUYOSPHERE, THE MANIPULATION OF DESIRES, THE ETERNITY OF HUMAN GREED, AND DEBT EVERLASTING.
